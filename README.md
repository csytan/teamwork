# teamwork

Welcome to the TeamWork project ðŸ‘‹. What the heck is it?

Let's start, by explaining the problem.

## The problems of open source software projects

- Author's goals may not align with audience's. Author might have created it for fun, whereas the audience might depend on it for work.
- Too many issues. Not enough time.
- Author's passion for project becomes dread of looking over issues/PRs.
- Too many pull requests. They get broken over time while waiting for a review.
- Ironically, there are plenty of people interested in improving the project.
- No easy way to make money

## There are plenty of popular open source projects that get "stalled out"

## How will we solve this? (these are ideas, not statements)

There is an enormous amount of value created in open source software today. Unfortunately, many projects miss out on capturing any of that value, to reinvest it to their projects. Some of the [best projects](https://vuejs.org/) learn early how to leverage [business](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou) [opportunities](https://vuejs.org/support-vuejs/) in order to grow their community.

Can we help automate this process for devs who are not so savvy?


## What will it be? Marketing lines -- used to explain
- A GitHub bot that helps open source projects grow from one maintainer to many
- Collaborative decision making for open source communities
- Software for group governence
- Open source, automated businesses
- The commoditization of business management through software
- Software development in the gig economy
- Programmable business models for open source projects
- Sustainable open source business models
- Non-profit angel investing
- Freelance for equity


## Motivations
- Remote friendly developer jobs
- Equity without the huge upfront commitment
- Increasing the alignment between businesses and their customers
- Transparency in operations (also helps with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor#Increasing_the_bus_factor)
