## The problems of open source software projects
- Author's goals often don't align with audience's. Author might have created it for fun, whereas the audience might depend on it for work.
- Too many issues. Not enough time.
- Too many pull requests. Things get broken.
- Author's passion for project becomes dread of looking over issues/PRs.
- No easy way to make money
